# CodeDead.com

This is the source code behind the CodeDead website.
The project was realized with the help of Gatsby, React, Material-UI and various other packages!

## Usage

In order to run a development build of the website, run:
```Bash
yarn start
```

A development server will be executed and you can then view the website in your browser using the following url:

`http://localhost:8000`

In order to build a production-ready version of the website, run:
```Bash
yarn build
```

`Gatsby` will then generate a static website that can be deployed on a server in seconds.
