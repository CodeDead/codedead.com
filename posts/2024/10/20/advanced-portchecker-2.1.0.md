## Information

Advanced PortChecker v2.1.0 has just been released. We've put a lot of effort into this release to try and make it the best version yet. This release includes a number of bug fixes, dependency upgrades, and new features to improve the overall experience.

For instance, you can now scan multiple IP addresses at once, which can save you a lot of time. In addition, you can now also add a subnet mask to the IP address, which can be useful for scanning a range of IP addresses.
We've also fixed a number of bugs and made some improvements to the user interface to make it more user-friendly.

Please note that starting with this release, macOS builds will be provided for aarch64 instead of x86_64. This change was made to better support the latest Apple hardware.

For a full list of changes, please see the changelog below.
