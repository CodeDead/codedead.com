For our first update of 2024 (late happy new year, by the way), we've remade Advanced PortChecker in Rust + JavaScript. We've completely revamped the user interface and made
it a lot easier to use and navigate.

The Rust rewrite allows us to now offer a Windows, Linux and macOS version of Advanced PortChecker AND improved scanning speeds. Whereas the old
version might have taken minutes to scan for open ports, the new version can do it in seconds!

If that's not enough, we've also made the binaries much smaller, less memory intensive and much more efficient, compared to the previous version, since you no longer need the .NET Framework
or the included libraries in order to run Advanced PortChecker.

For a full list of changes, please take a look at the change log below.
