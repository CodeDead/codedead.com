## Stuck pixels, we hate them !

That’s why we made a new tool called DeadPix to help solve pixels that are stuck on your screen. It works, simply by rapidly cycling the color value of the stuck pixel. We recommend leaving it on for at least 10 minutes. Please note that this tool does not provide a 100% success rate.

If you don’t know if you have any stuck pixels or if for some reason you can’t see your stuck pixels, you could try using the stuck pixel locator that is included in DeadPix. The stuck pixel locator will change the color of your entire monitor to a random or custom color so that the stuck pixels are more noticeable.

## But what exactly is a stuck pixel ?

A stuck pixel is a dot of color that fails to update when the pixels around it change.
Stuck pixels are most noticeable when the rest of the screen is black unless they are stuck to the color black.

## Where can I download DeadPix ?
