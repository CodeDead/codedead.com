## Other

We have noticed that this new release is being flagged as malware by a couple of major antivirus companies (again). We’ve had this issue before in the past with the first two versions of DeadLock. We will contact the antivirus companies that are falsely identifying DeadLock as malware but in the main time you could also help us out by contacting your AV’s support service if you’re having this issue. This issue has probably resulted thanks to the icon that we have added to the RegManager. In fact, take a look at a virusscan for the RegManager. This is to show just how absurdly inaccurate an antivirus can be, just by changing an icon. If you are interested in seeing the source code for DeadLock, please visit this page. This also includes the source code for the RegManager.

**EDIT (9/12/2015)**: We have contacted the Antivirus companies and they are currently removing the detections on DeadLock’s RegManager.

Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you need any support or if you’d like to submit a translation!
