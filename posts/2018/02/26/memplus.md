## Information

A new year, a new application! CodeDead is proud to introduce MemPlus! But, what exactly is MemPlus and more importantly, what does it do? Let’s find out!

MemPlus is a free application that can be used to monitor the RAM usage on your device. You can clear the memory of any non-essential processes by clicking the “Clear memory” button which is visible in the main window.
Even better, MemPlus can automatically clear your memory if a certain threshold is reached or after a specific amount of time has passed.

Since some processes are essential to your system, such as driver software, it is recommended to add them to the exclusion list if you experience any system instability, application crashes and/or performance issues. The exclusion list can be found in the settings window.

MemPlus also comes with a built-in RAM Analyzer which can tell you more information about the RAM that is installed in your system such as:

- Manufacturer data
- RAM capacity
- Configured clock speeds
- And more!

MemPlus has extensive logging capabilities and will log almost every action that is being done by the program. You can export or look at these logs to help you figure out any issues that MemPlus might be having. These logs can also be used to help us improve MemPlus if there are any issues for which support needs to be contacted.

As usual, MemPlus is available in both a portable and installer version.

**Am I reading this correctly? A memory optimizer that is actually free? Yes, that’s right. You don’t have to pay a single cent for this software!**
