## Information

MemPlus 1.3 has just been released. We’ve listened to your feedback and implemented many features that were requested to us by the community. We’ve also added a few new things and changed the UI a bit to make it more user friendly. We’ve edited the system requirements since it was estimated to high. Turns out, after extensive memory profiling, you need less RAM to actually run MemPlus!
