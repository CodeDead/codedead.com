Great news, we've just made Advanced PassGen 2.3.0 available for download! This release comes with a new feature: `The vault`, a safe and secure way to store and manage your passwords.
The password vault encrypts your data using AES-265 and stores a file locally that can be transferred to other devices. This allows you to easily manage your passwords on multiple devices and even on the web!

Do note that we do not store any of your data on our servers, so you can be sure that your data is safe and secure. We cannot recover your data if you lose your password, so make sure to remember it!

For a full list of changes, please take a look at the change log below.
