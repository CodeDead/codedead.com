We're happy to announce the latest release of Opal, version 1.2.0! This release contains a lot of improvements and new features, such as:

- Improved performance
- Improved stability
- Improved user experience
- Improved user interface
- Improved code quality
- Improved documentation
- Tray icon support
- Ability to shut down the computer with the timer functionality
- Ability to change the audio balance
- New translations for Japanese, Turkish and Chinese

In addition, we're now supplying binaries for macOS, in addition to the already available binaries for Windows and Linux.
Do note that the macOS binaries are not signed, so you will have to allow the application to run in your security settings.
Support for macOS will be improved in the future, but for now, it's a start.
