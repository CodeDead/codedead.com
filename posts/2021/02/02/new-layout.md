If you're a frequent visitor of our website, you might have noticed that we've switched over to an all-new design.

The previous version used WordPress to both manage and display the content on and off our website, but performance wise,
WordPress is quite heavy and slow.

In fact, we had a very low score on Google PageSpeed Insight for both mobile and desktop devices and as such, we decided to rework the entire site using
[GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.com), [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).

One thing to note is the increased performance: Our site will load approximately 3 times faster!
In addition, the entire website is completely open-source, meaning you can edit, build and even host your own
instance!

Some functionalities might still be missing at the time of this post, but bear with us while we update and improve the site and our server even further!
