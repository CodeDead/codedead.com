## Information

Advanced PortChecker v2.3.0 has just been released. This release is primarily focused on updating dependencies and improving stability across all platforms.
Thanks to community contributions, Japanese localization has been added as well.

Due to some bugs in the libwebkit2gtk library, Linux users will experience somewhat degraded performance (especially nvidia users).
We are actively working on resolving these issues and will provide updates as soon as possible. The previous version did not work at all on some recent Linux distributions, so this update is still an improvement.
