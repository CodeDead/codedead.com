Opal v1.5.0 has just been released. This time, we've improved the UI to make it more user-friendly. One such improvement, is the addition of a search bar to the sound library, which allows you to quickly find the sound you're looking for.

In addition to that, we've also added the ability to add your own sounds to the sound library! This feature is still early in development, but we're excited to see what you'll come up with.
Rest assured, we'll be adding more features to this in the future.
