## Information

We’ve just released AniView 1.0. A free, open source image viewer for animated GIF images. This software is the successor to Giv. As such, Giv will no longer recieve any updates and users should upgrade to the free and updated alternative AniView.

AniView is almost equivalent when it comes to features to Giv with the addition of several new items. For example, with AniView you can see how far along the animation currently is!

With time and updates, AniView will have support for all the features that were included in Giv and more!
