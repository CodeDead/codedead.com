## Information

AniView 1.3.2 has just been released. This is mainly a maintenance release. No new features have been added. Instead, we have improved upon already existing ones and updated the pause image to make it more apparant. We will admit that the pin image previously used was a bit rogue. It did not belong at all. Rest assured, this has now been fixed!

For our fellow developers out there, we have added plenty of new code comments and updated already existing ones! Please take a look at the change log posted below for a full list of changes.

## Changelog

- Updated pause icon
- Minor code optimizations
- Included latest theme version by Syncfusion
