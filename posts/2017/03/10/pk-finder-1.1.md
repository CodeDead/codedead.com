## Information

We’ve just released PK Finder version 1.1. We have fixed various typing errors, left there by previous iterations. We’ve also been working on a new library to check for software updates and we’re proud to say that PK Finder 1.1 is the first application to make use of this library. In this current version, the library isn’t much different from the old version. For now, we’ve made the UpdateManager publicly available for other developers to use in their applications. We’ve also included the latest Syncfusion theme version. This new theme version has some performance improvements. For a full list of changes, please take a look at the change log.
