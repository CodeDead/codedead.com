## Information

PK Finder 1.3 has just been released. We’ve included a couple of new settings for copying data to the clipboard. We’ve also fixed a minor issue with the GUI that was unfortunately introduced in the previous release. The help documentation has also been revised as a couple of legacy items were still visible. This should clear up some confusion.

Please take a look at the change log below to view all the changes that have taken place in this release.
