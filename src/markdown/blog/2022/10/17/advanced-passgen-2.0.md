## Information

As time goes on, so do our applications. We've just released Advanced PassGen 2.0, which is a complete rewrite of the application.
We've removed the .NET dependency and instead opted for a Tauri application.
This means that Advanced PassGen is now a native application, which is much faster and more lightweight than the previous version. In addition, it will
run on macOS, Windows and Linux without requiring the .NET Framework to be installed at all!
