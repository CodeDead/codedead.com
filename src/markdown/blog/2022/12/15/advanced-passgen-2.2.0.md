Advanced PassGen 2.2.0 has just been released. This release contains a couple of quality of life features that should greatly enhance the user experience.
One such example is the way exporting is done. In previous versions, exporting was done by clicking a button and then selecting the export type in a popup. This has now been changed to a dropdown menu that allows you to select the export type before clicking the export button.

Thanks to the community, the following languages have been added to Advanced PassGen:
* Chinese (Simplified)
